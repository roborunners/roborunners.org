## Sponsor Us!

Loma Linda Academy's Roborunners are a non-profit organization, funded by
individuals and corporations in our local community. We welcome any and all
sponsors willing to donate to an outstanding robotics team. Donating to us is
fully tax-deductible as we are a 501(c), and offers opportunities to advertise
your business through our website, robots, shirts, and other forums of
branding, in addition to being a great way to give back to the community.
