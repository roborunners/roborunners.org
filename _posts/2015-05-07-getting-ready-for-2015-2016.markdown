As many of those involved in the FTC might have notices, FIRST [announced][1] a
new technology platform for the FTC last month. This new platform is based on
Android and Qualcomm SnapDragon processors, though the processor information
is just marketing by Qualcomm.

This means a complete break from the old system, which consisted of NXT
controllers interfaced with the FCS via the Samantha module. This new system
uses two Android devices connected via Wi-Fi Direct.
