As many of those involved in the FTC might have notices, FIRST [announced][1] a
new [technology][2] platform for the FTC last month. This new platform is based
on Android and Qualcomm SnapDragon processors, though the processor requirement
is just marketing by Qualcomm.

This means a complete break from the old system, which consisted of NXT
controllers interfaced with the FCS via the Samantha module. This new system
uses two Android devices connected via Wi-Fi Direct.
