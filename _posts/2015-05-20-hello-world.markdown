Welcome to the new Roborunners website! This site is intended to serve as a
resource for both our team internally and the FTC community, as well as those
interested in the FTC as a whole. We intend document progress here, share
findings as we work on our robots, and highlight our competitions.

As to who we are, we are a third-year FTC team from Loma Linda, California.
This season marks our first real year of 'experience,' and we are excited to
get started.
