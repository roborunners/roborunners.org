The Roborunners try to involve themselves in both our local and the FTC
community, as outreach is a core part of the FTC.

## Open Source

The Roborunners give back to the FTC community by making as much of our robots,
tools, and websites as free and open source as possible. All of our open source
projects can be found at our [GitHub].

## Exhibitions

The Roborunners stage exhibitions to raise awareness of STEM, FIRST, FTC, and
robotics in our local community. To attend an exhibition, please look at the
planned dates on our [Events] page.
