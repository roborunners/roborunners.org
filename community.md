Roborunners involvement in the community.

## Open Source

The Roborunners give back to the local community and the FTC community by
making as much of our robots open source as possible. All files related to our
robots and tools can be found at our [GitHub].

## Exhibitions

The Roborunners stage exhibitions to raise awareness of STEM, FIRST, FTC, and
robotics in our community. To attend an exhibition, please look at the
planned dates on our [Events] page.
